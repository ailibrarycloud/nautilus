# Nautilus for RFP Responses and RFP Tracking
Nautilus can be used to research active and future RFPs. 

Nautilus can connect to multiple data sources and create a single source of truth for each RFP opportunity and answer frequently asked questions. 

You can create response templates to generate responses based on your past responses customised to current RFP.
